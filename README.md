# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Final Product
Tweet uses responsive design to show different views for mobile and desktop window sizes.

Clicking on the "Write a new tweet" button will toggle the new tweet form.

The new tweet form has a character counter showing the remaining character count.

The character counter will turn red if the user exceeds the limit.

Scrolling down will bring up the back to top button that will bring the user to the top of the page when clicked.
